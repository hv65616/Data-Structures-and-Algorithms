Implementation of Level Order Tranversal
// Find the the sum of binary tree at k level of nodes
// The code will be exact same just like the level order tranversal
// The only change is in place of displaying the data present at each level we will traverse upto that level then find the sum at that level of nodes
// Till then we will constantly adding all the elements in queue and will be removing it
